### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Yo yo.

My name is DinglyDo\
I smell your foo\
Don't twist things with my friend you fool\
Instead drool\
Over all of my groves\
I stomp you with my hooves\
My top languages be my crew\
[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=dinglydo&show_icons=true)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)\
Given that CPP is my top\
It's natural that I crop\
Because it's going rock botom\
Kind of like Harlem\
Yeah, Tell 'em Darlem

Yeah\
Tell 'em.
